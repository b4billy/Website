<h1>Getting Access to the NPS Data</h1>
<p>Happy National Park Week! Right before the WNBA Season starts, I wanted to do a very short and fun project with National Park Data that I found! The article goes through me explaining my favorite parts about the National Park Service (NPS) as well as digging into the National Park API that I recently discovered. This API does require a key which can be freely requested from <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm">this website:</a></p>
<p>To start the code, I initialized two variables: <code>base_url</code> that is the base url used for all API requests and <code>api_key</code> (not shown) which is a string of the API Key I recieved from NPS.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Enter API KEY in a variable called api_key

# Base URL
base_url &lt;- &#39;https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1&#39;</code></pre>

<div id="passport-cancellations" class="section level1">
<h1>Passport Cancellations</h1>
<p>One of my favorite things to do at National Parks is get my Passport Stamped<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. I have one of the Collector’s Edition Passports (<a href="https://shop.americasnationalparks.org/product/128482/Passport-To-Your-National-Parks%C2%AE-Collector%27s-Edition/">Available Here</a>), though I got mine when they originally came out and it has a harder cover than the one they are selling now. The majority of National Park Sites have a spot to get your Passport stamped, but some have multiple spots and cancellations! For example, a site may be part of a larger collection of sites such as the Underground Railroad. The next code chunk shows how many cancellations (according to the API) that one could get at a given National Park. I would presume this is full time stamps and excludes special event stamps such as the Total Solar Eclipse Cancellation from April 2024.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get Passport Stamp Locations
passport_json &lt;- httr2::request(paste0(base_url, &#39;/passportstamplocations&#39;)) %&gt;% 
  # Add API Key and Limit to the url in the query
  httr2::req_url_query(&#39;api_key&#39; = api_key,
                       &#39;limit&#39; = 2000) %&gt;% 
  # Perform the request
  req_perform() %&gt;% 
  # Get the JSON

# Count the number of stamps per park
stamp_count_df &lt;- stamps_df %&gt;% 
  #&#39; Every Park has a unique code of around 4 characters that uniquely identifies each park
  #&#39; We want to count the number of stamps per park so we group by parkCode and then 
  #&#39; count the number of rows to tell us approxiately how many stamps there are!

    summarise(numberOfStamps = n()) %&gt;%

<div id="junior-ranger-programs" class="section level1">
<h1>Junior Ranger Programs</h1>
<p>My other favorite thing to do at National Parks is the Junior Ranger Program. Between myself and the rest of my family, we have around 200 Junior Ranger badges! The Junior Ranger Program allows kids, called Junior Rangers, to complete the activity booklet as well to earn their badge. Of course, they also allow “Not So Junior Rangers” to complete the booklet and receive the badge as well. The NPS API also has records of which sites have Junior Ranger programs. I wanted to pull the list of these sites and merge them together with the Passport Cancellations from earlier!</p>

<div id="combining-data-frames" class="section level1">
<h1>Combining Data Frames</h1>
<p>Now that I have a data frame for each of the Passport Stamps and the Junior Rangers, we need a way to combine them. Luckily, each National Park Site has a unique Park Code that is used to identify each park.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Combine the datasets and replace NAs for number of stamps with a 0
full_nps_data &lt;- left_join(junior_ranger_df,
                       stamp_count_df,

  # If the Stamp count is missing, replace it with a 0
  replace_na(replace = list(numberOfStamps = 0))

# Select Only Data Desired
filtered_nps_data &lt;- full_nps_data %&gt;% 
  select(fullName, parkCode, states, description, latitude, longitude, designation,
         numberOfStamps) %&gt;% 
  # convert coordinates to numeric
  mutate(latitude = as.numeric(latitude),
         longitude = as.numeric(longitude)
  ) %&gt;% 
  # Unnesting even more columns so that the data frame is only made of vector columns
  unnest(c(fullName, parkCode, states, description, designation))</code></pre>

<div id="map" class="section level1">
<h1>Map</h1>
<p>I’ve always wanted to create a map with National Park Information so here is that map! I used <a href="https://rpubs.com/RagtagCreature/898538" class="uri">https://rpubs.com/RagtagCreature/898538</a> to get started!</p>
