<p>I have created a series of tutorials to help those new to sports analytics become learn about the programming language R! These tutorials were used during Fall 2021 to help teach the Sports Analytics Club at NC State and were recorded. The link to the recordings as well as the code are linked below:</p>

<p>The topics covered in each tutorial are listed below:</p>
<p><strong>intRo 1- Basics of R</strong>: This video includes coding basics such as data structures, data types, good commenting practices, and how to use the help function. Skills also taught are tidyverse functions useful for manipulating data such as select() and mutate(). In the recording, skip to 17:15.</p>

<p><strong>intRo 2- Plotting in ggplot2</strong>: This 1st part of the tutorial describes how to read in data as well as very basic web scraping html tables. The web scraping information is only found in the code, due to time constraints, this was not recorded. The 2nd part of the tutorial is about where to find data on the internet. A lot of the data sources can be found on Brendan Kentâ€™s website <a href="https://brendankent.com/2021/03/09/free-sports-data-sources/" class="uri">https://brendankent.com/2021/03/09/free-sports-data-sources/</a>. Finally, this tutorial introduces plotting with the ggplot2 package by walking through the process of making a histogram with data from <a href="https://kenpom.com" class="uri">https://kenpom.com</a>.
