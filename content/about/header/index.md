<!-- this is a subheadline -->
Hi my name is Billy Fryer and this is my first website. I am trying to use this as a platform where I can publish short articles about sports analytics or any other statistical work that I do.

The page you are reading is based on a markdown file- look in `content/about/` to edit. There, look inside the `header`, `main`, and `sidebar` folders to get started building your own "about" page.
