  I am an undergraduate junior (3rd year student) at North Carolina State University studying Statistics and Spanish. I am from Columbiana, Alabama - a small town halfway between Birmingham and Montgomery.
  
  I currently work with the NC State Women's Basketball and Baseball teams. I am also the President of the Sports Analytics Club at NC State. In the future, I hope to be a sports analyst for a pro sports team.
