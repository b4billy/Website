  I am an undergraduate junior (3rd year student) at North Carolina State University studying Statistics and Spanish. I will graduate in the Spring 2023 Semester. I am from Columbiana, Alabama - a small town halfway between Birmingham and Montgomery.
  
  I currently work with the NC State Women's Basketball and Baseball teams. I am also the President of the Sports Analytics Club at NC State. In the future, I hope to be a data scientist in the sports analytics field.
  
  The NC State College of Sciences did a feature about me! A link to the article is here: [Using Statistics to Support Champions](https://sciences.ncsu.edu/news/using-statistics-to-support-champions/).
