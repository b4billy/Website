  I am currently the Basketball Data Analyst for the Indiana - the second one in the entire WNBA. I am from Columbiana, Alabama - a small town halfway between Birmingham and Montgomery.  I graduated from North Carolina State University with degrees Statistics and Spanish.
  
  I previously worked with the NC State Women's Basketball (2021-2023) and Baseball (2019-2023) teams. I was also the President of the Sports Analytics Club at NC State from 2021-2023. I also interned with John Deere in Summer 2021 and with Sports Reference in Summer 2022 contributing to their launch of the Women's College Basketball site!
  
  During my junior year of college, the NC State College of Sciences did a feature about me! A link to the article is here: [Using Statistics to Support Champions](https://sciences.ncsu.edu/news/using-statistics-to-support-champions/).
